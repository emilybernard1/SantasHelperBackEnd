## MVP
- An app that looks and functions on a basic level; with a navigation bar, div boxes that display the users wish lists for their loved ones, the capability to update and delete said lists, as well as make secret lists for stocking stuffers (Santa's Secrets).

## Example Seed Data 
```
const startGifts = [
    { name: "James", gift: "Schitt's Creek Game", type: "board game", isBought: true, isWrapped: true },
    { name: "Vivi", gift: "Art Class Sweater", type: "clothing", isBought: true, isWrapped: false },
    { name: "Beth", gift: "Magic Mixies", type: "toy", isBought: false, isWrapped: false },
