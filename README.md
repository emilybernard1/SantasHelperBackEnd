## MVP
- An app that looks and functions at least as well as the Pet App we did in class, with a navigation bar, and div boxes that display the users resources and allows the user to edit and delete them as well as make updates to them and make secret lists for stocking stuffers.

## Example Seed Data 
```
const startGifts = [
    { name: "James", gift: "Schitt's Creek Game", type: "board game", isBought: true, isWrapped: true },
    { name: "Vivi", gift: "Art Class Sweater", type: "clothing", isBought: true, isWrapped: false },
    { name: "Beth", gift: "Magic Mixies", type: "toy", isBought: false, isWrapped: false },
    { name: "Ryleigh", gift: "christmas pjs", type: "clothing", isBought: false, isWrapped: false },
    { name: "Gavin", gift: "christmas pjs", type: "clothing", isBought: false, isWrapped: false }
]
```
